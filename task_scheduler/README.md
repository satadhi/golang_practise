# Phase 1: Basic Project Setup â€“ In-Memory Delayed Task Queue

## Features

- `POST /push` â€“ Add a task with payload and delay
- `GET /consume` â€“ Fetch one task thatâ€™s ready
- Goroutine-based scheduler
- In-memory task queue and ready queue

Why it's Poll-Based:
You expose a GET /consume endpoint.

A worker (consumer) polls this endpoint to check if a task is ready.

The server doesnâ€™t push the task â€” instead, the client must ask repeatedly or on interval.

### ðŸ“Œ Why It's Poll-Based

- You expose a `GET /consume` endpoint.
- A worker (consumer) **polls** this endpoint to check if a task is ready.
- The server doesnâ€™t **push** the task â€” instead, the client must **ask repeatedly or at intervals**.
